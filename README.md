# SOCI 280 101 2023W1: Dear (My) Data

This repository contains the code I wrote for the first assignment, Dear (My) Data, of the SOCI 280 101 Data and Society course at UBC.

For details, read the Write-Up. It is hosted with GitHub pages: https://jstet.github.io/dear_my_data/

## Project Structure

- The code that produces the write-up is contained in `index.rmd`.
- `data` contains a libre office spreadsheet that I used to manually enter data and a csv derived from that
- `images` contains images used in the report including an image of the physical and digial visualization required for this assignment
